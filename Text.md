# Driving the style-guide-driven development

## 1. Cover

Hello. This talk is going to be about the style-giude-driven development. Currently is it a highly recommended and popular practise.

We actually can check this statement. How many of you develop the style-guides? And who wants?

Particularly I will focus on automating this approach, on how we could delegate some aspects of this method to the robots and tools.

## 2. About me

Before the style-guides, let me introduce myself. My name is Varya. I am a frontend developer originally from Russia and currently based in Helsinki, Finland.

There is my twitter account here in the slide. If you have any question regarding the talk or another one, feel free to ask. We can meet in person after the talk. But if someone prefers twitter, go ahead.

I work there for a pretty nice company called "SC5 Online". We are a consultancy company, mostly focused of front-end, preferably complex stuff. Nowadays, among other approaches we are brining the style-guide and user-interface-component practise to our client processes.

So, I would say that this is my main area of expertise. For years I've been focused on long-running projects, mostly from the front-end perspective. They were sometimes massive projects and often sets of projects sharing the same interface. This is why "UI libraries" are also here in the slide. And this all resulted in the experience in style-guide-driven development, which I can share today with you guys.

## 3. Cleaning up the process

If I would be asked to desribe briefly what I do, I would answer that I clean up the process. Of course, I write CSS and JavaScript. And I write tools serving this process, you will see one of them in this talk. But this is really secondary thing.
The main thing I do and the main goal I am trying to achieve is to fix the process, to find what is wrong with it and then fix it. Often happens, to fix it with a special tool.

The same goes for the style guides and the style-guide-driven development. We felt that we had some problems and there should have been something, there should have been a way to change it. Here it is:

## 4. Old school way

In here I drew an obvious, canonical way of making the websites. The process goes like that:

- A designer creates a mockup, usually a Photoshop file. Or a set of files, one file for every page.
- Then it goes to a person who develops HTML/CSS and they produce the actual markup. It might be the same guy who drew a design, does not matter. But this is usually a next stage in the process.
- Once the markup is ready, this means that we have a dummy page equiped with all the needed styles and with JavaScript. Then we can bring it into real life, meanin implement it into server. This is how it goes in production.

For me this sounds like a typical process. Is it?

## 5. Dash process

Now let's have a closer look at it.

In timeline it should look like this. Firsly there is some time to create a design. When design is ready, we can start with the markup and the last stage is the server integration. Looks perfect. The problem is that it never goes like that :-)

In real life the designers need more time to create a mockup. Maybe we underestimated it. But more likely that new requirements appeared after the guys had already started. So, the design got ready later.

Then, the coding HTML/CSS process probably cannot start right away. The markup guy may have other things to do, so it goes later.

After that often happens that new stuff appeared in the mockup and we throw away the coded HTML/CSS and start again.

Here is does not even come to the integration, there is no place in the slide.

This is only for the first iteration. However when mantaining the interface, such things happen over and over again. So the picture could be even worse. Every time getting fixed drawing from a designer, we figure our what has been changed. Then provide the same changes to our coding.

The same goes for a set of pages. Drawing of pages does not say us what are the common parts in the interface, we need to figure it out ourselves. And we do so many times.

## 6. Old school way

Usually it results into inconsistent visual system. It takes special effort to keep the interface coherent, the old-school process does not offer any automatic way for it.

The next thing is posible inconsistency in code. Especially in large websites the process is very risky in this sense. And for a set of websites sharing the same style, it is very very challengable not to repeat yourself in code.

Then, if it is needed to provide visual changes in the interface, it might be tricky. Asuming the inconsistent code we have, even a little visual change such as new styles for all the buttons or controls can be difficult thing to do.

The old-school process is time-consuming as it makes us to overcome the inconsistency chanllenge all the time.

And, no matter how successful we are in current iteration, it is more likely that we get the same unmantainable result next time. I say "unmaintainable" meaning that all this challenges appear again. So, we may have fixed the interface but we did not fix anything in the proccess.

## 7. Websites are systems

So, the recent strong movement in the frontend development is to understand that we  are not coding the pages. We are developing websites, which are systems much more complex than just a set of pages.

Understaning this results into different way of developing.

## 8. Modular CSS Architecture

To do so people came up with modular solutions for CSS. It can be Object-Oriented CSS, SMACSS, BEM, atomic design. Does not really matter what to choose, they all serve the same purpose. With them we can modularize the interface and develop it as a set of components.

## 9. Modular CSS process

Such an approach may provide the process changes as well. So that every component can has its own development cycle.

Of course, there can be difficulties in developing each of them any way. But the modular process is much easier to manage. As they've said "divide and rule".

It is easier to estimate when talking about these small pieces. Easier to asign them to different team members and so share the work. It is easier to test the result, and the tests can even be automated. And if a problem appears, it is easier to solve becaue it is scoped.

## 10. Getting out of your comport zone

However all this modularizing thing is very easy to be said. But it is much harder to be done.

Mostly because it is out of our comfort zone. We see the pages, not sets of components. Moving towards the components-based interfaces is cultural challenge, it needs us to fix something in our mindset.

## 11. Living style guides

There is a solution to help us with it, the living style-guides.

Before the style guides was mostly used to document the work of visual designers. Often is was a PDF file with the used colors, basic interface elements and so one.

But this was not very helpful for the frontend developers to take in practise this component approach because it was also a drawing.

Much better thing are the living style-guides. They are web pages which fit all the used interface pieces. And these interface is rendered with exactly the same styles which are used in the product. So such a style guide reflect all the changes.

## 12. Style-guide-driven development

We can go even further. If there is such a living style guide, why not to develop style guide fist?

If a new interface piece appears, we first code it in the style guide. When it is finished and polished, we bring it into real system. The style guide website uses the same styles, so it is almost zero amount of work to bring ready-made component into the product.

This is like "documentation first", but for user interfaces.

The idea sounds very good. But again â€” the cultural challenge. But also a technological one.

## 13. The tool we missed

We can do nothing with the mindsets. It is a chanllenge for each of us to overcome on our own. But as engineers we can make it so that all the technical things would happen automatically.

This is what we though it our company. We were very excited about using this style-guide-driven and component approach. So we wanted to implement it in our projects. But we also wanted that most of the technical things about that were solved in advance. This is to make the process as smooth as possible.

There is a lot of living style guide solutions already but we missed some features. So we developed our tool which actually extends one existing solution.

We call it simply. Just style guide generator by SC5. Here you can see a link to its page. It is actually open source tool, so there is its github repository with all the commmits and issues. Check it out.

And I will show and explain its features and the development workflow we have.

## 14. Easy to start

We wanted the tool to be easy to start. So, it is an npm package. You can install it into your website. The run a command and the tool takes your CSS and automatically builds a style guide.

If works for the popular syntaxes such as pure CSS, SASS and LESS. We do not know in advance what is used in the next project. So, the tool should work everythere.

Our style guide generator extends anotehr one, KSS. It uses KSS as a dependant package. So, the documentation for the components goes in style files in KSS syntax. In general the idea of keeping the documentation close to code is nice and promises benefits. And KSS as a syntax became quite popular so we wanted for most of the project to e able to try our tool right away.

It is gulp- and grunt- integrated out of box. This is very important for the style-guide-driven process to happend. Because no one would use additional command when developing. But if the style guilde website appears after you run your usual gulp command, this is completely different story.

So, let me show you in code.

This code belongs to a pattern library of one client of ours. They are a very big Finish, Sweden and Estonian company, a mobile operator Elisa. They have a lot of websites which share the same style. So, they have this repository of components.

`ls public_html/scss`

These are the style files.

If we open one of them, for example _molecules.scss, you can see that inside are comments which document the code. This is the KSS syntax. It says what is the compoennt below, what markup it needs, what are its possible modifications.

Then in `package.json` of this project you can see that there is `sc5-styleguide` package installed. This means that I can run it.

In here the generator is used with Gulp, so I run its task (`gulp styleguide-watch`).

It does something and runs the local server. Let's see what it is.

So, this is the website. The components from css files are represented here. This is a list of them. We were looking for a subset of them called 'Molecules' Here they are (click).

So, every component is described. There is a list of possible modifiers. Then, all the modifications are rendered right here. And this is real HTML, it works.

Each example can be also opened in a full screen mode. So, pure page with one component only. This is very useful for automated UI testing. When a new version of the pattern library appears, a robot can visit all the links, take screenshots and compare previous version and current one. So if padding is wrong or a border is missing, it is easy to spot.

Then, below there is a markup needed for this component. This is what is used to render it above.

And there is also the corresponding piece of CSS. Just for your information.

## 15. Easy to keep up to date

So, as you could see, the style guide is automatically generated from the actual source code of the product website. It takes the information from the documented code.

And there is one more feature I need to show you. The Angualr directives support.

As you could see, it is needed to document the markup for every component so that the tool knew what to render. However this might be not very useful when mantaining. If markup changes, it makes a developr to fix it here first and then go and fix it in the product. We did not like it, so we added Angualr directive support.

For example here, (`public_html/scss/_angulardirectives.scss`) there are our angular components. And it is declared what is a directive to render it.

Then, if we go to its styleguide page, we can see that it is rendered normally. This is because the styleguide loads the directory and applies it. So, everything works exactly like in the product application.

When we will need another markup and so change the directive, it automatically changes in the styleguide. There is no need to reflect these markup changes manually.

## 16. Use as a development playground

Then, as our main goal is to encourage developers to focus on the style guide first, we needed to make this generated website a good development playground. So, the next features serve for that.

Let us open the molecules again. Now I will change their styles. Let us change this color for example.

After saving the document you can see that the website refreshes itself and new styles are applied.

(scroll)

Then, we have this nice "Designer tool" button here. It opens a panel where the variables and their values are listed. It shows only the variables used in the current component. If I scroll down, it changes the list.

It is always possible to show them all. But for large systems it is usually such a long list. So, this related variables feature is a pretty nice feature.

This is possible because in the tools we are using a real parser. So, no regexps. And this helped us to implement next features.

Then, the values here are edittable. Let's try. I will change this blue color into green. As you see, it changes the appearence. And if I go and check in the file system, you cal see that it made changes there.
This is very helpful for non-technical guys to fix something. Especially at the final stage, when interface is being polished. And the changes are in real styles. Later they can be commited into the repository.

Again, this is only possible with using real parser. We use Gonzales. The regexp solutions we tried eairlier, are not that good. So, we also came to this wisdom of no-regexp.

Then, another good thing is that I can find all the components where this variable is used. This is a list of them. So, when changing something, I can visually check everything affected.

Also it is possible to search through the CSS code of components. For example, all the components using background. Or all the components, whose markup includes our inputs. If we had changed the input, we could check it everythere.

## 17. Cross-company style guide process

So, we use this generator and it is very much embedded into our process. For example, this pattern library belongs to our client. And their websites use it to get coherent interfaces.

However, this is never ending process and we obviously need different teams not only use the library but also to contribute into it. This is where our tools helps. When the developers need to fix a component, they do not do it in there products. They generate the styleguide over the library website and develop there. Then. they contribute into the library with pull requests. The same goes for new components.

The library in versioned and is also a package, but this is a different story.

Our client says that it saves them 25% or working time.

## 18. Style Guide Generator by SC5

We are trying it out right now and I can say that this is a veru benefitable approach.

We have our UI documented and well structured. The system encourages us to keep it clean.

Developing the component isolated, we can quickly test them. Also these searching features help a lot.

Then, the pre-given kit of UI components is good for build-out new pages. We do not repeat ourselves and reuse a lot.

The unit test for UI, eirther functional Protractor and so on, or visual with aytomatic screenshort comparisson sound very promissing.

As a result the product is good, visualy consistent, clean coded. People used shared code and company libraries when they are easy to use.

Its helps the whole teem to be at the same page. Literraly. There is a page with components, a designer and a developer are looking at it at the same time and they are seeing the same thing. They both know what is implemented and how exactly it works. Also helps for remote teams, we are trying it right away at our client's.

And, our main goal, the style-guide-driven mindset is much closer. I would not say that we have solved this problem, because this is not about tools, this is about our culture. But with the tools we technically help as much as we can.

## 19. Developers mindset

And the culture we are hoping to develop through this process is so that developers would consider interfaces not as pages but as modular systems.

## 20. Thank you
