"I liked the idea of having to think about a design in pieces, and then also think about it as a whole."

"I found very helpful during this project to have your ideal CSS architecture and organization documented before you
do any refactoring."

"Keeping Style Guides Current and Useful"

"A common question I’ve received at conferences is, “How do you find time to work on a style guide?” — which is a very
valid question."

"I think the more automated you get and the more integrated into your workflow the style guide becomes, the more useful
it will be — and it can actually be quite fun."
